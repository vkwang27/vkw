	<h1> MYT Cooking and Guitar Classes </h1>

	<p> For four weeks, students attended Makenew's Multiply Your Talents workshops and learned new skills! Two of those workshops were the cooking and guitar classes. In the cooking class, they learned how to poach and fry eggs, cut vegetables, and even cook fried chicken!</p>
	<p> In the guitar workshop, they learned how to play some basic chords and strum. Only a few chords away from a Chris Tomlin song! </p>
